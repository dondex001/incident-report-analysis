# 🛡️ DDoS Attack Incident Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project provides a cybersecurity incident analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a multimedia company. The analysis is structured using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.  

## 🗂️ Report Summary  
- **Identify:** Attack exploited an unconfigured firewall with ICMP flood, causing 2 hours of downtime.  
- **Protect:** Implemented new firewall rules and IP verification to block spoofed traffic.  
- **Detect:** Added monitoring software and IDS/IPS for abnormal traffic detection.  
- **Respond:** Blocked ICMP packets, shut down non-critical services, restored critical operations.  
- **Recover:** Updated configurations, improved incident response playbooks, and trained staff.
